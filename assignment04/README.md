# Assignment 04 - Multigrid Solver for 2D Poisson Equation

This project implements a geometric multigrid solver for the 2D Poisson equation on a unit square domain. It supports different numbers of grid levels, smoothing steps, and grid sizes. Residual trends are logged and visualized for convergence analysis.
